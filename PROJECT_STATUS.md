# Project Status Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Today

### 1. **Fixed Route Conflict**
- **Issue**: Duplicate `/static` route registration causing panic
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate from `routes.rs`, kept single registration in `server.rs`
- **Result**: Server starts successfully

### 2. **GGUF Analysis**
- **Finding**: SmolLM3 GGUF lacks standard Llama metadata keys
- **Impact**: Can't use Candle's `ModelWeights::from_gguf` directly
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive analysis in `/doc/gguf_integration_status.md`

### 3. **Improved Error Handling**
- **Added**: Detailed metadata inspection on load failure
- **Added**: Graceful fallback to stub mode
- **Added**: Better logging of what's missing

### 4. **Created Development Tools**
- `analyze_warnings_detailed.sh` - Comprehensive warning analysis
- `cleanup_warnings.sh` - Automated warning fixes
- `test_build_and_run.sh` - Quick build and run test
- `inspect_gguf.rs` - GGUF metadata inspector

## üöß Current State

### Working
- ‚úÖ Web server runs
- ‚úÖ Chat UI displays
- ‚úÖ Stub mode responds
- ‚úÖ Tokenizer loads
- ‚úÖ GGUF file validates

### Not Working
- ‚ùå Actual model loading (metadata mismatch)
- ‚ùå Real text generation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 127 warnings need cleanup

## üéØ Immediate Priorities

### Priority 1: Clean Warnings (Quick Win)
```bash
chmod +x cleanup_warnings.sh
./cleanup_warnings.sh
```
This will:
- Auto-fix most warnings
- Format code properly
- Leave ~20-30 warnings that need manual review

### Priority 2: GGUF Metadata Resolution
Three options:
1. **Add metadata to GGUF** (recommended)
   - Create script to inject missing Llama keys
   - Based on SmolLM3 architecture specs
   
2. **Custom loader** (more work)
   - Bypass Candle's quantized_llama
   - Load tensors directly
   
3. **Different model format** (easiest)
   - Find/convert to different format
   - SafeTensors or unquantized

### Priority 3: Test Real Generation
Once model loads:
- Test basic completion
- Verify streaming works
- Check memory usage

## üìù Questions for You

1. **Model Priority**: Should we focus on getting ANY model working (even unquantized) or specifically the Q4_K_M quantized version?

2. **Timeline**: What's your target for having a working prototype?

3. **Features**: What's most important?
   - Speed of inference
   - Quality of responses  
   - Memory efficiency
   - Streaming smoothness

4. **Fallback Plan**: If GGUF proves too difficult, are you open to:
   - Using ONNX format?
   - Running Python inference server?
   - Using different quantization?

## üöÄ Recommended Next Actions

### Option A: Quick Path (1-2 days)
1. Clean warnings (1 hour)
2. Download different model format (30 min)
3. Use simpler loading approach (2-4 hours)
4. Basic generation working (2-4 hours)

### Option B: Proper Path (3-5 days)
1. Clean warnings (1 hour)
2. Fix GGUF metadata properly (4-8 hours)
3. Implement custom loader (8-16 hours)
4. Full feature implementation (8-16 hours)

### Option C: Hybrid Path (2-3 days)
1. Clean warnings (1 hour)
2. Get unquantized model working first (4 hours)
3. Then tackle quantization (8-16 hours)
4. Optimize performance (4-8 hours)

## üí° Key Insights

1. **The architecture is solid** - The 3-tier design, streaming, and UI all work well

2. **Model format is the blocker** - Everything else is ready, just need proper model loading

3. **Stub mode proves the concept** - The system works end-to-end in stub mode

4. **Candle expectations** - Candle's quantized_llama is very specific about metadata format

5. **Community solutions exist** - Other projects have solved this, we need to find/adapt their approach

- [llama.cpp converter](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/convert.py) - Can add metadata

## üìä Success Metrics

When we're done, we should have:
- [ ] Model loads without errors
- [ ] Generates coherent text
- [ ] Streams tokens smoothly
- [ ] < 30 warnings
- [ ] Memory usage < 4GB
- [ ] Response time < 2s for first token
- [ ] 1-2 tokens/second generation
