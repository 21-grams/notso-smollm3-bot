Let me explain why those numbers (0.5-1 t/s on CPU, 5-10 t/s on GPU) are in the expected range, and it's not necessarily a failing of your code or the Candle framework itself.

Model Size: The SmolLM3-3B-Q4_K_M is a 3-Billion parameter model. Even when quantized to 4-bits, this requires an immense number of calculations for every single token.

Hardware:

CPU (8-core): LLM inference is a massively parallel task. A consumer CPU, even with 8 fast cores, is simply not structured for the thousands of parallel operations needed. 0.5-1 t/s for a 3B model on a CPU is standard.

GPU (RTX 3060): An RTX 3060 is a good consumer card, but it's not a data center GPU like an A100 or H100. Its memory bandwidth and CUDA core count are the primary bottlenecks. The 5-10 t/s range is a very typical result for this class of hardware running a 3B model in a straightforward, non-batched implementation. You'd see higher numbers on an RTX 4090, and much higher on data center hardware.

Implementation: Your current loop is for a single user/prompt. Production inference servers (like those from NVIDIA or Anyscale) achieve high aggregate throughput by using techniques like continuous batching, which your "Next Steps" correctly identifies. Your single-stream performance is a measure of latency, not maximum server throughput.

So, to be clear: your estimates are not low, they are realistic. This is the baseline performance for this class of model on this class of hardware.

2. Should you still continue with the Candle ecosystem?
This is the key question. The answer is: It depends entirely on your project's goals.

Candle is a fantastic choice, but it shines for specific reasons. Let's weigh the pros and cons.

✅ Reasons to Continue with Candle
Deployment Simplicity (This is its superpower): With Candle, your entire application—web server, chatbot logic, and ML model—compiles down to a single, self-contained binary. There is no Python interpreter, no requirements.txt, no dependency hell. You can deploy it in a tiny Docker container or even as a standalone executable. This is a massive operational advantage over Python-based stacks.

Safety and Control: You are in pure, safe Rust. You have granular control over every aspect of the generation loop, memory, and threading, all without worrying about the complexities of C++ bindings or Python's GIL. Your code is likely more robust and less prone to runtime errors.

WASM and Edge Computing: Candle is one of the few frameworks that can be compiled to WASM, allowing you to run your model directly in a web browser or on edge platforms where Python is not an option.

Rapidly Improving Performance: Candle is under heavy, active development by Hugging Face. Performance is a key focus. Optimizations for Metal (macOS), Flash Attention, and improved CUDA kernels are constantly being added. The performance gap with C++/Python libraries is closing.

⚠️ When to Consider Alternatives (like Python + vLLM)
Your #1 Goal is Maximum Throughput Today: If you are building a high-traffic, public-facing service that needs to serve hundreds of concurrent users with the lowest possible cost per token right now, then specialized Python-based inference servers like vLLM or NVIDIA's TensorRT-LLM are currently faster. They use highly optimized, hand-tuned C++/CUDA backends and have mature implementations of continuous batching.

You Need the Absolute Bleeding Edge: The Python ecosystem (PyTorch, Transformers) will almost always get the newest model architectures and research techniques first.

My Recommendation
Given that it's getting late in the evening for you in New Taipei City, let's keep it simple.

I would strongly recommend you continue with Candle.

Your project seems to be a self-contained chatbot application (SmolLM3 chatbot). The benefits of a single, reliable, easy-to-deploy Rust binary are enormous. The performance you're seeing is sufficient for a single-user experience, a small-scale web app, or an embedded application.

Focus on implementing your "Next Steps":

Optimize your existing loop: Ensure you're running in --release mode and using all available optimizations.

Implement batching: If you need to serve multiple users, implementing static batching will give you a significant throughput boost.

Don't mistake the baseline latency of a 3B model for a failure of the framework. You've chosen a modern, robust, and highly promising stack. The trade-off is a slight performance delta against more complex, less safe, and harder-to-deploy Python alternatives. For most projects that aren't trying to be the next ChatGPT, it's a trade-off well worth making.
