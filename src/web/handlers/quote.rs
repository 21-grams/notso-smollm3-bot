*Recovery Version*

**1** In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

**2** He was in the beginning with God.

**3** All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being.

**4** In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.

**5** And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.

**6** There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.

**7** He came for a testimony that he might testify concerning the light, that all might believe through him.

**8** He was not the light, but came that he might testify concerning the light.

**9** This was the true light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man.

**10** He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, yet the world did not know Him.

**11** He came to His own, yet those who were His own did not receive Him.

**12** But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name,

**13** Who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

**14** And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality."#;
